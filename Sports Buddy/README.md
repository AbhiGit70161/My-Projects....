## 1. Project Overview 📌

**Sports Buddy** is a real-time, modular web application designed to bridge the gap between sports enthusiasts. By moving away from fragmented group chats to a structured **BaaS (Backend-as-a-Service)** model, this platform allows users to host, discover, and join sports matches in their local areas with real-time updates and role-based access.
